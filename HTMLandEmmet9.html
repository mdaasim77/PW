    <h3>
        Self-closing tags, also known as void or empty tags, are HTML tags that do not have a closing tag. They are used to represent elements in HTML that do not contain any content or require a closing tag for proper interpretation by web browsers. Instead, they are closed within the opening tag itself using a forward slash ("/").
    </h3>
    <p>
        Common examples of self-closing tags include <b> &lt;br&gt; </b>
</b>
</b>
</b>, <b> &lt;img&gt; </b>
</b>
</b>
</b>, <b> &lt;input&gt; </b>
</b>
</b>
</b>, and <b> &lt;hr&gt; </b>
</b>
</b>
</b>. These tags are used for line breaks, inserting images, creating input fields, and adding horizontal rules, respectively.

<h3>
    Here's a brief note on meta tags:
</h3>
<p>
    Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata or additional information about a web page. They are placed within the&lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document and are not visible to users visiting the page. Instead, they serve as instructions or data for browsers and search engines.
</p>
<p>
    Meta tags are typically defined using the &lt;meta&gt; tag, which is a self-closing tag. They use attributes to specify different types of metadata. Some common attributes used in meta tags include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b> name:  </b> Specifies the name of the metadata.

    </li>
    <li>
         <b> content: </b>  Contains the actual value or information associated with the metadata.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Meta tags serve various purposes, including:
</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b> Page Description:</b> The description meta tag provides a brief summary or description of the web page's content. Search engines may use this information in search results to provide users with a preview of the page.

    </li> <br>
    <li> <b> Keywords:</b> The keywords meta tag was previously used to specify keywords relevant to the web page's content. However, search engines now rely less on this tag for indexing and ranking.</li><br>
    <li>   
        <b> Character Encoding:</b> The charset meta tag indicates the character encoding used in the web page. It ensures that browsers interpret and display the content correctly.</li><br>
    <li>  
        <b> Viewport Configuration:</b> The viewport meta tag is used to control the viewport settings, such as the width, scale, and initial zoom level, for responsive and mobile-friendly web pages.</li> <br>
</ol>
<h3>
    Meta tags play a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO) by providing information to search engines and improving a web page's visibility in search results. They also contribute to the overall accessibility, rendering, and user experience of a web page.
